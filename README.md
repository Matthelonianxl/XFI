# XFI

XFI takes advantage of the HTML5 file input in order to provide a better user experience for multiple file uploads from a single file input.

XFI is for people who want to simply have better file inputs in their forms with support for multiple file uploads. If you're looking for features like drag and drop, asynchronous uploads and progress bars then you might want to try something else.

XFI is a simple jQuery plug-in that can be easily integrated into your existing code.
